# Building Periodic

## Environment Setup

I used the grunt package template from my git hub to set up the application (this doesn't need to be done unless you're creating an applciation from scratch)

It essentially creates the shell of the node application, by setting up the test directory, and rudimentary package information

### installed global node modules
* express
* mocha
* grunt
* less

### Writing good code: JSHint, Linting javascript
you code should pass linting before commiting, you can do this through your IDE (i'm using sublime text, installed through the package manager) check out (https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-JSHint) I installed with the sublime text package manager, you can also set up grunt to lint on save (a grunt watcher but I didn't go through this).

### Writing better code: Mocha tests, Testing javascript
write tests before you write code, using mocha: http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/

### Less

### package.json
